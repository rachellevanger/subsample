Subsampling Persistence Diagrams Project
========================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shaunharker/subsample.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shaunharker/subsample) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/shaunharker/subsample/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/shaunharker/subsample?branch=master)

This software package includes tools used to find
delta-sparse, delta-dense subsamples of point clouds.
The code uses Open-MPI and runs in parallel in HPC
environments. In particular we focus on the special case
where the points of the point clouds correspond to 
Persistence Diagrams (or tuples thereof).
