# Dependency

The program uses ANN library (http://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN/),
modified to support deletion of points from k-d trees.
The modified version is contained in "ann" directory.

# License

The program is distributed under Lesser GPL license.

# Building

First build the modified version of ANN in ann/ directory following the
instructions for ANN compilation.
Then cd to "bottleneck" directory and build the program with make.
The executable "bottleneck" will appear in bottleneck/build/default.

Usage: bottleneck file1 file2  [relative_error]. 
If relative error is not supplied, the exact distance is computed.
file1 and file2 must contain persistence diagrams in plain text format 
(no headers, no comments, one point per line):

x_1 y_1
...
x_n y_n
