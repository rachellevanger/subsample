==== Subsample ====

subsample will accept four command line arguments:
```bash
/path/to/sample.json delta p /path/to/subsample.json
```
where `sample.json` is a file containing paths to persistence diagrams
```json
{"path":"/base/folder","sample":[["...","...","..."],["...","...","..."],["...","...","..."],...]}
```
and `delta` is the subsampling parameter (we want to achieve a delta-sparse, delta-dense subsample).
The sample.json file may contain additional fields which can be ignored.

The output of the subsample program will be stored in the supplied filename `/path/to/subsample.json` and will be of the following form:
```json
{"sample":"/path/to/sample.json","delta":delta, "p": p, "subsample":[...]}
```

==== Distance ====

The input to the distance program is the output from the subsample program. The arguments are
```bash
/path/to/sample.json /path/to/subsample.json /path/to/distance.txt
```
where the first two paths are the original sample and the output of the subsample program, and the third path is the location the distance matrix is to be stored.
