==== Subsample ====

subsample will accept three command line arguments:
```bash
/path/to/sample.json delta p
```
where `sample.json` is a file containing paths to persistence diagrams
```json
{"path":"/base/folder","sample":[["...","...","..."],["...","...","..."],["...","...","..."],...]}
```

The sample.json file may contain additional fields which can be ignored.

The output of the subsample program will be
```json
{"sample":"/path/to/sample.json","delta":delta, "p": p, "subsample":[...]}
```

==== Distance ====

The input to the distance program is the output from the subsample program. Optionally the two parameters `delta` and `p` may be given, in which case they will override the values in the file.
